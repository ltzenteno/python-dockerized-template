### Dockerized Python Backend Application

I created a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` with an empty `Poetry` config ready to be used and install the prefered frameworks / plugins.

It is configured to work with a PostgreSQL database.

#### Installation

1. clone this repo

2. build containers with

        docker-compose build

It will create the `db` and `app` images along with a `postgres_data` volume

A Django empty app is provided being created with the command (this was done outside the container):

	docker-compose run backend django-admin startproject app .

**NOTE:** _if you want to use other framework different that Django, just remove `app` dir and `manage.py` file and create your own app with the framework of your choice (outside the container), also modify `entrypoint.sh`_

#### Installing new Poetry dependencies

By default the container comes with Django 3.1.5 as a dependency, it can be modified to use any other framework (i.e. Flask) that would mean to remove the `backend` dir and `manage.py` file generated by django

To install more dependencies run the following command:
